==================
Solution Approach:
==================
-> Enable notifications by setting 'configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS' to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h
-> Create two static tasks (T1 & T2) with IDLE priorities
-> T1 will be the computation task which has a long computation workload
-> T2 is a communication task which has a smaller work load.
-> Both the task will be started in the scheduler
-> After a fixed number of computational units of T1, T1 will notify T2 to execute and will wait for a notification from T2.
-> T2 will be waiting for the notification from T1. Once received, it will execute and notify back to T1 after completion and wait.
-> T1 will again execute for another fixed number of computational units and notify T2 and wait.
-> T2 will again execute once it receives the notification from T1 and after completion notify back and wait.
... and so on ...
-> Once T1 reaches it total computational units the execution halts
