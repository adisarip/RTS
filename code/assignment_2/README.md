# Real Time Systems (Assignment-2):

### Q1
> Create the two tasks in FreeRTOS. The first task should occupy the processor for a long time â€“ you can create a task with a very long delay in the task code. Generally, this can be considered as a computation task (such as a large matrix multiplication task) on an embedded system, which occupies the processor for most of the time. There is another task which is a communication task, which needs to send data every time a certain number of computations/time duration elapses (say 100 computations). Implement triggering of communication task from the computation task *(Hint: Use Notifications).*


#### Solution Approach

- Enable notifications by setting 'configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS' to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h
- Create two static tasks (T1 & T2) with IDLE priorities
- T1 will be the computation task which has a long computation workload
- T2 is a communication task which has a smaller work load.
- Both the task will be started in the scheduler
- After a fixed number of computational units of T1, T1 will notify T2 to execute and will wait for a notification from T2.
- T2 will be waiting for the notification from T1. Once received, it will execute and notify back to T1 after completion and wait.
- T1 will again execute for another fixed number of computational units and notify T2 and wait.
- T2 will again execute once it receives the notification from T1 and after completion notify back and wait.
... and so on ...
- Once T1 reaches it total computational units the execution halts
